How to manipulate text using R.

The rationale - we want to be able to pick out parts of strings (or split them=.
Or manipulate them in other ways. Glueing them together so we make one 
string out of two.

Or replace parts of a string with something.
Or remove parts of a string.  Which is basically the same as replacing something,
here we are just replacing with nothing

fra https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/stringr.html:

Character manipulation: these functions allow you to manipulate individual characters within the strings in character vectors.

Whitespace tools to add, remove, and manipulate whitespace.

Locale sensitive operations whose operations will vary from locale to locale.

Pattern matching functions. These recognise four engines of pattern description. The most common is regular expressions, but there are three other tools.
