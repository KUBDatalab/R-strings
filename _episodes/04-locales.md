Danish and English text is relatively similar. We use the same letters, except
that Danish includes the weird letters æ, ø and å at the end of the alphabet.
The alphabet is in the same order except for those. And the rest of let 
letters are the same.

Not so in the rest of the world. And we need to be able to handle that.

(we are NOT looking into )


```r
library(stringr)
```


```r
x <- "I likes Ike"

str_to_lower(x, locale = "tr")
```

```
## [1] "ı likes ıke"
```


```r
x <- c("y", "i", "k", "q", "w", "x", "ư", "♂", "♀", "s", "ß", "Ŧ", "Γ")
str_sort(x, locale="gr")
```

```
##  [1] "♀" "♂" "i" "k" "q" "s" "ß" "Ŧ" "ư" "w" "x" "y" "Γ"
```



```r
# In Lithuanian, y comes between i and k
str_sort(x, locale = "lt")
```

```
##  [1] "♀" "♂" "i" "y" "k" "q" "s" "ß" "Ŧ" "ư" "w" "x" "Γ"
```




```r
str_sort(x, locale = "tr")
```

```
##  [1] "♀" "♂" "i" "k" "q" "s" "ß" "Ŧ" "ư" "w" "x" "y" "Γ"
```

Locale sensitive
A handful of stringr functions are locale-sensitive: they will perform differently in different regions of the world. These functions are case transformation functions:

x <- "I like horses."
str_to_upper(x)

str_to_title(x)


str_to_lower(x)
# Turkish has two sorts of i: with and without the dot
str_to_lower(x, "tr")

String ordering and sorting:

x <- c("y", "i", "k")
str_order(x)


str_sort(x)

# In Lithuanian, y comes between i and k
str_sort(x, locale = "lt")


The locale always defaults to English to ensure that the default behaviour is identical across systems. Locales always include a two letter ISO-639-1 language code (like “en” for English or “zh” for Chinese), and optionally a ISO-3166 country code (like “en_UK” vs “en_US”). You can see a complete list of available locales by running stringi::stri_locale_list().
