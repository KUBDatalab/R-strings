We would like to be able to manipulate text. 

We have 10.000 texts on our computer. Which of them contains the word "history"?

How many contains the word "history"? Both lowercase and upper case?

How many of them contains the word "history" more than 10 times? 

How many of them have the word "history" as more than 1% of the words in the books?

Is there a way to change the word "history" to "chronicle" in all of these files?

This is manipulation of strings.

In this course we will look at how text can be manipulated using R.

We will begin by looking at the foundation. How do we manipulate single strings.

The techniques used noget med at de fungerer vektoriseret ogs책.

We are going to work almost exclusively with the stringr package from the tidyverse.
